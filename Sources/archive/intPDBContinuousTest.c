/*
 * Important note:
 *
 * The file Project_Settings -> Startup_Code -> kinetis_sysinit.c needs to be modified so
 * that a pointer to the PDB0Isr function is in the vector table at vector 88 (0x0000_0160)
 * for Programmable Data Block (PDB).
 *
 * The following declaration needs to inserted earlier in the file:
 *   extern void PDB0Isr(void);
 *
 * If using the GCC Toolchain, the vector table is named "InterruptVector", and the line:
 *   Default_Handler,		(comment delimiters removed) Vector 88: PDB
 * needs to be changed to:
 *   PDB0Isr,			(comment delimiters removed) Vector 88: PDB
 *
 * If using the Freescale Toolchain, the vector table is named "__vect_table", and the line:
 *   (tIsrFunc)UNASSIGNED_ISR,    (comment delimiters removed) 88 (0x00000160) (prior: -)
 * needs to be changed to:
 *   (tIsrFunc)PDB0Isr,		  (comment delimiters removed) 88 (0x00000160) (prior: -)
